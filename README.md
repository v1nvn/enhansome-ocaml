## Concurrency

Before OCaml 5.0, there were two libraries for concurrent programming: *Lwt* and *Async*. They provide very similar functionality but make radically different decisions with regards to error handling and internal implementation details (see the links below for more details). [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/) uses Async, but a version of the [code examples translated to Lwt](https://github.com/dkim/rwo-lwt) ⭐ 106 | 🐛 0 | 🌐 OCaml | 📅 2017-06-04 is also available.

With the introduction of [Effect Handlers](https://ocaml.org/manual/effects.html) in OCaml 5.0, a bunch of other libraries have been created for concurrent programming, replacing the monadic approaches of LWT and Async with direct-style ones.

* **Libraries**:
